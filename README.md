# Kinematic Controller 

This repo holds an implementation of a kinematic controller for Unity. It is based on ideas from [this repo](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyController) and can serve as a starter point for more refined works. As a personal point of view, after months of struggling with Rigidbodies controller sensitivies and tuning, I've found kinematic controllers to be refreshing and much easier to tune.
